# Quiz Application Using MERN Stack

## Overview
The Quiz Application is a comprehensive platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that offers two distinct portals: one for administrators and another for users. This application allows users to take quizzes and provides admins with tools to manage quizzes effectively.

## Features

### Admin Portal
- **Quiz Management:** Admins can create new quizzes, add questions, and modify existing quizzes.
- **Question and Answer Management:** Admins can update questions and answers for each quiz.
- **User Reports:** Admins can view reports on user performance and quiz completion statistics.

### User Portal
- **User Login:** Users can register and log in to their accounts.
- **Quiz Attempting:** Users can attempt quizzes assigned to them.
- **Results and Feedback:** After completing a quiz, users can view their results along with the correct answers for all questions.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js for building user interfaces and enhancing user experience.
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js for handling server-side logic and API requests.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user data, quizzes, questions, and results.
